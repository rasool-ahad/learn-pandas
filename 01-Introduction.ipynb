    "**Pandas** is a high-performance open source library for data analysis in Python developed by Wes McKinney in 2008  as a result of frustrations he encountered while working on time series data in R. It is built on top of NumPy and provides features not available in it. It provides fast, easy-to-understand data structures and helps fill the gap between Python and a language like R. NumPy deals with homogeneous blocks of data. Using pandas helps to deal with data in a tabular structure composed of different data types."

    "- It can process a variety of datasets in different formats: time series, tabular heterogeneous, and matrix data.\n",
    "- It facilitates loading/importing data from varied sources, such as CSV and databases such as SQL.\n",
    "- It can handle myriad operations on datasets: subsetting, slicing, filtering, merging, groupBy, re-ordering, and re-shaping.\n",
    "- It can deal with missing data according to rules defined by the user/developer, such as ignore, convert to 0, and so on.\n",
    "- It can be used for parsing and munging (conversion) of data as well as modeling and statistical analysis.\n",
    "- It integrates well with other Python libraries such as statsmodels, SciPy, and scikit-learn.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Data representation**: It can easily represent data in a form that's naturally suited for data analysis via its DataFrame and series data structures in a concise manner. Doing the equivalent in Java/C/C++ requires many lines of custom code as these languages were not built for data analysis but rather networking and kernel development.\n",
    "- **Data subsetting and filtering**: It permits easy subsetting and filtering of data, procedures that are a staple of doing data analysis.\n",
    "- **Concise and clear code**: Its concise and clear API allows the user to focus more on their core goal, rather than having to write a lot of scaffolding code in order to perform routine tasks. For example, reading a CSV file into a DataFrame data structure in memory takes two lines of code, while doing the same task in Java/C/C++ requires many more lines of code or calls to non-standard libraries."

However, this is not really the case for pandas."

    "The basic version of pandas was built in 2008 by Wes McKinney, an MIT grad with heavy quantitative finance experience. Now a celebrity in his own right, thanks to his open source contributions and the wildly popular book called Data Analysis with Python, he was reportedly frustrated with the time he had to waste doing simple data manipulation tasks at his job, such as reading a CSV file, with the popular tools at that time. He said he quickly fell in love with Python for its intuitive and accessible nature after not finding Excel and R suitable for his needs. But he found that it was missing key features that would make it the go-to tool for data analysisâ€”for example, an intuitive format to deal with spreadsheet data or to create new calculated columns from existing columns."
